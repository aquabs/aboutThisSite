            Camas Girls Who Code
          </h1>
          <p>
            The Camas Chapter of Girls Who Code was founded in 2017 and meets in room 506 on fridays from 2:30-3:30. It is a community environment or sisterhood in which girls can learn to code together. This past year we focused mainly on HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) simply because our community impact project was in website developement. Coding is involved in so much of our lives. Members were able to persue various coding interests such as electronic music, drawing, website developement and fashion. We plan to continue the expansion and immersion of the club into more and more topics people are interested in.

         <h2>Why an Impact Project?</h2>

         <p>In the business or 'real' world you work with a group of people to acheive a task. You are never working alone because every person a team has a different outlook and skill set. The idea with the Impact project is very similar, it is at times frustrating learning how to code because you have a vision already, you just need to find a way to translate that to the computer. By working together you may come across an idea or style from someone else that you never would have thought of. Through collaberation and cooperation on this project we can learn to code together.</P>

          <p>This year for our impact project we are designing a centralized place for information about the different clubs at Camas 
          highschool. We decided to do this by using a variety of the Core4 activity sets to learn HTML and CSS. Each club member was responsible for a club of their choosing, which they spent a variety of weeks working on enhancing their coding skills through experience. </p>
